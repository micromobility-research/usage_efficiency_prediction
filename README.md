# usage_efficiency_prediction

Abstract

A machine learning based approach is developed to predict the usage efficiency of shared e-scooters using GPS-based vehicle availability data. First, the usage efficiency of shared e-scooters is measured with the indicator Time to Booking at the trip level. Second, ten exploratory variables in time and space are calculated as features for the prediction based on the e-scooter trips and other related data. Last, three typical machine learning methods, including logistical regression, artificial neural network and random forest are applied to predict the usage efficiency by inputting the features.
